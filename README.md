I use this repository to manage documents, codes, and other learning source for AutoCAD learning
As a mentor of AutoCAD, I try to establish solutions of learning AutoCAD.
I had establised the Wechat Public Number to support my students learning Architectural AutoCAD since 2015.
In the begining, I just published some message to assign task or reference of AutoCAD learning.
Student were attracted by that fresh way at first, but then they were boring. I realzed it is too blank that nobady can keep intresting in it.
For 4 year I have modified my pedagogics continuously and formed a optimized solutions and learning stratigies. And I will try to code those stratigies and made a learning platform to support AutoCAD learning in various majors such as Horticulture Design, Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Photoclectric Engineering.
